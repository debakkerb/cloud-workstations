# Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate Cloud Workstations. The code creates the following resources:

- Enables the necessary APIs
- Create a Cloud Source Repository to host the code.
- A Cloud Build trigger to create the Workstation images.
- A Cloud Build trigger to create the Terraform code.
- A Schedule that recreates the Cloud Workstation images on a nightly basis.
- A Workstation cluster
- A Workstation configuration
- A Workstation with Intellij

Cloud Scheduler is used to trigger an automated build every 24 hours. The reason is that Google publishes updated images
on a regular basis. Every time a workstation is restarted, it pulls the latest image from Artifact Registry and uses
that to spin up the Workstation. This ensures that you always have the latest packages and latest version of your IDE.
If you don't want this behaviour or you want to use a fixed version for, let's say, Intellij, you can always update the
corresponding Dockerfile and refer to the proper version.

**IMPORTANT**: Because of this behaviour, anything that sits outside your home directory doesn't persist across
sessions. That means that if you use package managers to install anything, you need to update the corresponding
Dockerfile.

# Install

Run the following script to create everything in a Google Cloud project you manage.

## Setup codebase and local environment

```shell
# Ensure you are logged in with your Cloud Identity
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login

# Clone the repository and remove the .git files
git clone https://github.com/debakkerb/cloud-workstations.git && cd cloud-workstations 

# Store the current directory in a variable
PARENT_DIR=$(pwd)

# Remove the .git folder, as we are going to create a Cloud Source Repository for this code
rm -rf .git
```

## Terraform code

In this section, you will create a `terraform.tfvars`-file in the [01_-_base](./01_-_base)-directory. Make sure to
update `<PROJECT_ID>` and `<CREATE_PROJECT>` first, before you hit enter.

```shell
# Move to the correct folder
cd 01_-_base

# Create terraform.tfvars file with the necessary variables for the base-folder
cat >> $PARENT_DIR/01_-_base/terraform.tfvars <<EOL
project_id     = "<PROJECT_ID>"
create_project = <CREATE_PROJECT>
admin_user     = "$(gcloud config list --format json | jq -r .core.account)"
EOL

# Initialise Terraform
terraform init -upgrade -reconfigure

# Apply the changes
terraform apply -auto-approve

# Init terraform again and type 'yes' when the system asks you to copy the state remotely
terraform init
```

## Git

We've now created a Google Cloud project with all necessary resources to start creating the Workstation cluster, config
and images. As we are using Cloud Build and Cloud Build points to Cloud Source Repositories, we need to reinitialise Git

Currently, all `backend.tf`-files are ignored. They contain the configuration for the Storage buckets to store the
Terraform state files. When you're working with a private repository and you control who has access to it, you can
remove them from .gitignore and store them in Git as well. This will allow you to work on the same state from different
locations and with different users.

```shell
# Initialise a new Git repository
git init $PARENT_DIR

# Set Origin
$(terraform output -json | jq -r .git_repo_init_cmd.value)

# Set the branch to main
git checkout -b main

# [OPTIONAL] Remove backend.tf files from .gitignore
sed -i '/backend.tf/d' $PARENT_DIR/.gitignore

# Add all files and commit them
git add --all && git commit -m "Initial setup"

# Push local changes
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

## Workstation Preparation

In this part, we'll create an Artifact Registry repository and create the base images for both OSS and Intellij
workstations.

```shell
# Switch to the correct directory
cd $PARENT_DIR/02_-_workstation_base

# Apply the Terraform changes
terraform init -upgrade -reconfigure
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## Workstations

In this section, we will create the workstation for your personal use. You can either create a Workstation instance with
Intellij or OSS (or both). By default, an instance with Intellij is created, but you can change this behaviour by
updating the following variables:

- `create_intellij_workstation`: Set to true in case you want to create a Workstation instance with Intellij (default)
- `create_oss_workstation`: Set to true in case you want an image with OSS

Create a `terraform.tfvars`-file in [03_-_workstations](./03_-_workstations) to override the default values for these
variables.

```shell
# Switch to the correct directory
cd $PARENT_DIR/03_-_workstations

# Apply the Terraform changes
terraform init -upgrade -reconfigure
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

Once finished, you should be able to access your Workstation in the UI. In case you are using Intellij, following
the [JetBrains Gateway instructions](https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/develop-code-using-local-jetbrains-ides)
to access your Workstation.

# Update base image

If you want to add additional packages to your Cloud Workstation, you can update the Dockerfiles for your preferred
IDE ([Intellij](./00_-_modules/workstation-image/Dockerfile_intellij), [OSS](./00_-_modules/workstation-image/Dockerfile_oss)).
If you want to install a set of plugins, you can follow the instructions
listed [here](https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/customize-container-images#sample_custom_dockerfiles).

# Update Workstation Configuration

The default configuration in this repository spins up a Workstation with the following baseline configuration:

- Machine type: `e2-standard-8`
- Disk size: `100GB`
- FS Type: `ext4`
- Disk type: `SSD`

You can update these values by creating (or updating) a `terraform.tfvars`-file
in [03_-_workstations](./03_-_workstations) and adding the following variable:

```shell
workstation_host_config = {
  machine_type = "<DESIRED_MACHINE_TYPE"
  disable_public_ip_addresses = true
  shielded_instance_config = {
    enable_secure_boot = true|false
    enable_vtpm = true|false
    enable_integrity_monitoring = true|false
  }
}

workstation_directories_config = {
  mount_path = "<HOME_DIRECTORY>"
  gce_pd = {
    size_gb = <SIZE>
    fs_type = "<FS_TYPE>"
    disk_type = "<DISK_TYPE>"
    reclaim_policy = "<RECLAIM_POLICY>"
  }
}
```

# Project creation

By default, the code will create a project and create the resources in there. If want to deploy the resources in an
existing project, you can set the variable `create_project` to false in a `terraform.tfvars`-file in
the [01_-_base](./01_-_base)-directory. If you do this, make sure that `project_name` matches the project ID of the
existing project.
